# To_Do-list-manager
Simple to-do list manager

The code uses functions to modularize operations like adding, viewing, and removing tasks. It reads from user and writes to a tasks.txt file using Pythonâ€™s file handling to ensure persistence. A simple loop-driven menu guides user interaction via the command line. Lists are used to store tasks in tasks.txt file. OS module is also used for file handling.
